# Retail Profitability & Cost Optimization System

## Executive Summary
This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics pipeline built for a retail business
struggling with low profit margins. Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I identified cost
leakages and modeled strategies that project an improvement in profit margin from
~8% to 25%+ without increasing revenue.
